In the Cross-check, data sources are compared to determine the level of consistency and reliability between data sources with the same or similar information. Select the source documents you will use for each of the 3 cross-checks.
* Cross check 1- Primary and Secondary Documents*
    - This cross-check is a comparison of data elements between a client service delivery register and another register for a service delivery support unit, such as the pharmacy or laboratory.  For this comparison, the rationale is to ensure that information in the support unit registers is being updated correctly in the primary service delivery register for the program area or indicator, and that the information is the same in the two data sources.
* Cross check 2- Document 1 and Document 2*
    - This Cross-check is a comparison of data elements between different client service delivery data sources, such as a register and a medical record or client-held card. For many treatment programs (e.g., HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis), the primary source document is the patient card (or treatment card), usually a component of a larger medical record for the patient. A summary of the information in the patient card is kept as a register to facilitate the aggregation of data for reporting purposes. The rationale for the cross-check is to ensure that the data are accurately transcribed from the primary source document to the secondary source.
* Cross check 3- Document 1 and Document 2*
   - This Cross-Check is the comparison of service delivery volume between the service delivery information system (malaria or health programs) and the commodities tracking information system for indicators that use commodities, such as drugs or test kits (e.g., logistics management information system). Please choose one source document for each of these categories.
