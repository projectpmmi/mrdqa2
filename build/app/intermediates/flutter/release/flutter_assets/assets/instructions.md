# Malaria Routine Data Quality Assessment Tool: A Checklist to Assess the Quality of Malaria Program Data Instructions

A comprehensive approach to data quality assurance should include three complementary approaches using standardized methods and tools. These approaches are as follows:
* Routine and regular (i.e., monthly) reviews of data quality built into a system of checks of the malaria or other program reporting systems as part of a feedback cycle that identifies errors in near real-time so that they can be corrected as they occur.
* An annual independent assessment of a core set of tracer indicators to identify gaps and errors in reporting and the plausibility of trends in health facility data reported during the previous year.
* Periodic in-depth program-specific reviews of data quality that focus on a single disease or program area and are timed to meet the planning needs of the specific programs (e.g., before program reviews).

This tool aims to standardize and facilitate the routine review of malaria data quality at health facilities, by the district monitoring and evaluation teams that support them via routine supervision to health facilities.
1. To begin using this application for RDQA, go to the Configuration module to configure the application to pull facilities, indicators and data elements from the national instance of DHIS2.
    * Select the facilities you want to assess using this device.
    * Select the indicators and data elements that will be assessed for accuracy and consistency.
2. Next, go to the Indicators module to configure the data elements and data sources you will want to use in your supervision visits.
3. When you are ready to plan a supervision, go to the Supervision Planning module.
4. During supervision, go to the Data Entry module to add data for the supervision.
5. After supervision, you can view data from the supervision in the Dashboard module.
6. Finally, go to the Data Quality Improvement module to use in generating action plans during the supervision visit to make plans based on the assessment.
7. Go to “Export” to export data from each supervision.
